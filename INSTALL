For help with this install, please join the savonet users mailing list at:

Make sure that you have all the dependencies installed on the apache host machine.
Apache, Mod Python, TagPy, Django are all necessary to get washtub working.  Once
all these are installed, continue on with the installation. Liquidsoap can theoretically
be running anywhere that is network accessible from the washtub instance.

Download the washtub svn from the savonet project.

	svn co https://savonet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/savonet/trunk/washtub washtub

Copy the directory to a permanent location on the filesystem (I like /usr/share )

	cp washtub /usr/share -R  

Copy the washtub-apache-dist.conf into the apache conf directory to setup 
the django/python environment.

	cp /usr/share/washtub/washtub-apache-dist.conf \
	   /etc/apache2/sites-available/washtub.conf

Edit the new washtub.conf file with your own options.  Then link to it in 
the 'sites-enabled' directory.

	ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/washtub.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/

Copy the washtub/django settings-disy.py to a permanent settings.py file.  Edit
the new settings.py to match the options in washtub/apache configuration

	cp /usr/share/washtub/wtsite/settings-dist.py \
	   /usr/share/washtub/wtsite/settings.py
	vi /usr/share/washtub/wtsite/settings.py
	
If you want to access local media on the washtub host, be sure to set the mediapool
path in settings.py.  Also, make sure this dir is writable by the apache user 
*and* the liquidsoap user. At this time, only mp3 and flac are supported on washtub.
	
	MEDIAPOOL_PATH = '/full/path/to/mediapool/dir' 
	
At this point, washtub should be configured.  Now setup the database using 
the internal django tools.

	python /usr/share/washtub/wtsite/manage.py syncdb
	
Now restart apache to enable the new configuration file. 
NOTE:  You have to restart apache everytime you make changes to the 
settings.py or the washtub.conf files.

	/etc/init.d/apache2 restart

We still have to connect washtub to your liquidsoap instance.  Make sure 
that telnet is enabled in your liquidsoap script via:

	# Enable Telnet
	set("server.telnet",true)
	set("server.telnet.bind_addr","127.0.0.1")
	
You can also setup queues in liquidsoap to control from washtub.  The 'id' 
parameter is very important to specify how washtub will control queues.

	admin_request = request.queue(id="admin_request")
	public_request = request.equeue(id="public_request")
	myplaylist = fallback(track_sensitive=false,
                                   [admin_request,
                                    public_request,
                                    myplaylist])
                                    
Browse to http://localhost and hopefully your site is live.  Now, let's connect
washtub to liquidsoap.  Login to washtub using the super password that manage.py
asked you for.	Add a host to the admin interface using the following settings.
	
	Name:  Human readable name
	IP Address: Address of liquidsoap telnet bind address
	Base Url: http://your-icecast-server:8000
	Theme: click the '+' to add a new theme 'default'

Now add some entries to the settings table to correspond to the new host.

	Value 		Data 	Hostname
	port		1234	your-liquidsoap-hostname
	protocol	telnet	your-liquidsoap-hostname
	
If you setup queues in liquidsoap, you need to specify some settings that will
washtub to control them specifically.

	Value 		Data 			Hostname
	queue_id    liq-queue-id  your-liquidsoap-hostname
	queue_id    liq-queue-id  your-liquidsoap-hostname
	
And that should get things up and running.  For troubleshooting, try browinng to 
these urls to check that washtub is actually working.  In addition to byypassing
the ajax call, this will also present django debug messages if the urls fail.

	Media Pool Scan -> /mediapool/scan
	Node Status -> /status/nodes/<liquidsoap_hostname>
	Queue Status -> /status/queues/<liquidsoap_hostname>
	History -> /status/history/<liquidsoap_hostname>
	Help -> /status/help/<liquidsoap_hostname>

	Pool Display ->
	/pool/<liquidsoap_hostname>/song/1  #this would display page 1
	/pool/<liquidsoap_hostname>/song     #this would display all without any paging


Good Luck.
